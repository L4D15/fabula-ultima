# Fabula Ultima (Unofficial)
Fabula Ultima (unofficial) System for FoundryVTT

## Build

- Clone the repo anywhere, it's not necessary (nor recommended) to clone it inside Foundry's systems folder.
- Create a `foundyconfig.json` file and set the absolute path to Foundry's Data folder.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run build:dev` to build and copy all the files into Foundry's system folder.

Exmaple for `foundryconfig.json`:

```
{
  "data_folder": "/Users/ladis/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT/Data"
}
```
